# MacOS Setup

Here be a bunch of files to automate some of the setup for a Mac. 

## Step 1
Run `brew.sh` to install homebrew, tooling and applications from the mac store. 

You might need to run this twice, to get `mas` installed before the Store applications are installed

## Step 2
Run `set_defaults.sh`, which will apply a bunch of preferences without having to trawl menus. 

This needs a restart aferwards so brace for that
